# Project Readable

This is an assessment project for Udacity's [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019), developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

# Installing Dependencies and Running the application

### `npm install`
* installs all the development dependencies

### `npm start`
* runs the application at localhost:3000 
* runs an aditional server API at localhost:5001

## Specific Assessment Requirements
* Use React and Redux to build your application UI
* All application state is managed by the Redux store. State-based props are mapped from the store rather than stored as component state. There are times in production environments when it is appropriate to have components own some part of their own state. Since the purpose of this project is to assess the ability to implement Redux in code, that is not an option available for this project.
* Updates are triggered by dispatching actions to reducers

## API Server
This assessment used the [Readable API Server Starter Template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) but was changed to be able to run with the app. 
The endpoints were kept. You can find more information on how to perform API calls [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter/tree/master/api-server).

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Material-UI
The styling and UI components are bootstrapped with [Material-UI](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta). You can find more information and usage examples in the [documentation website](https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/).
